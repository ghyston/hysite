# hysite
Blog engine on .net

[![Build docker image, push to dockerhub, deploy on linode](https://github.com/ghyston/hysite/actions/workflows/deploy_to_linode.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ghyston/hysite/actions/workflows/deploy_to_linode.yml)
-----

This is a small hobby project for learning .net development and deployment. Actual blog contains some posts, but they are not so interesting, as git log for this repository.

## main features:
* using git repository as host for blog posts
* posts are markdown files with custom header
* hosted on [linode](http://linode.com/) linux vm, running in docker
* actual site is here: [Hyston Blog](https://hyston.blog/)
